## 1. Motivation

This notebook is largely based on the paper [Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf) [1]. A few high level notes and tips from the paper include:

+ The Skip-gram architecture in Figure 1 of Mikolov _et_ _at_. actually only involves training of two matrices - the input and output matrices. The Skip-gram architecture does not involve a separate output matrix for each output context word. 
+ Since the Skip-gram model fits a one-to-many mapping of words, the point is not to get any particular mapping between a pair of words correct, but rather to use this fitting procedure to fit a good input word matrix whose columns (or rows) are vector representations of words that capture syntactic or semantic word relationships.
+ The Skip-gram model assumes distributional hypothesis, which assumes that a word's syntactic or semantic meaning is correlated with the type of words it is surrounded by.
+ Larger context window $\pm m$ results in more training examples and thus can lead to a higher accuracy, at the expense of the training time.
+ The Skip-gram model presented by Mikolov _et_ _at_. is called word2vec.

## 2. Dataset

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from collections import Counter
import math
import string
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

We will train word2vec using [IMDB movie review dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews/data). Standard cleaning steps for the text dataset is adopted from this [tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-word-embedding-model-predicting-movie-review-sentiment/).

+ Remove punctuations:
```
!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~
```
+ Remove characters not alphabetic.
+ Remove stop words from [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/). Stop words usually are most common words in a language filtered out before natural language processing. 
+ Remove tokens, or fundamental units of text, with length one.

Mikolov _et_ _at_. removed some frequent words from the text, since frequent words provide less information value than rare words. To implement this, each words $w_{i}$ in training is discarded with probability 

$$P(w_{i}) = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{t}{f(w_{i})}},$$

where $f(w_{i})$ is frequency of word $w_{i}$, and $t$ is a chosen threshold, set to $10^{-5}$ in the paper. Another data preprocessing task from Mikolov _et_ _at_. is removing all words that occured less than 5 times. 


```python
# load doc into memory
def load_doc(filename, directory = "data/"):
    # open the file as read only
    data = pd.read_csv(directory + filename, sep = ",")
    reviews = list(data['review'])
    return reviews
 
# turn a doc into clean tokens
def clean_doc(reviews, stopwords):
    t = 10**(-5)
    
    # remove punctuation from each token
    table = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    # filter out stop words
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

    cleaned_reviews = []
    for review in reviews:
        # split into tokens by white space
        review_tokens = review.split()
        review_tokens = [w.translate(table) for w in review_tokens]
        # remove remaining tokens that are not alphabetic
        review_tokens = [word.lower() for word in review_tokens if word.isalpha()]
        review_tokens = [w for w in review_tokens if not w in stop_words]
        # filter out short tokens
        review_tokens = [word for word in review_tokens if len(word) > 1]
        cleaned_reviews.append(review_tokens)
    tokens = [token for review_tokens in cleaned_reviews for token in review_tokens]
        
    # subsampling of frequent words
    word_counts = Counter(tokens)
    total_count = len(word_counts)
    drop_prob = {word: 1 - math.sqrt(t / (count / total_count)) for word, 
                 count in word_counts.items()}
    reviews_subsampling = []
    for i in range(len(cleaned_reviews)):
        review = cleaned_reviews[i]
        review_tokens = [word for word in review if np.random.random() <= drop_prob[word] and word_counts[word] >= 5]
        reviews_subsampling.append(review_tokens)
    return reviews_subsampling
```

Clean the dataset.


```python
reviews = load_doc("IMDB_Dataset.csv")
cleaned_reviews = clean_doc(reviews, stopwords)
```

Integer encode tokens.


```python
tokens = [token for review in cleaned_reviews for token in review]
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_tokens = label_encoder.fit_transform(tokens)
article_lengths = [len(review) for review in cleaned_reviews]
```

Split tokens by reviews.


```python
encoded_reviews = []
start = 0
for i in range(len(article_lengths)):
    encoded_reviews.append(encoded_tokens[start:(start + article_lengths[i])])
    start = start + article_lengths[i]
```

Generate training dataset. 


```python
def generate_training(encoded_reviews, window):
    X, Y = [], []
    for review in encoded_reviews:
        for i in range(len(review)):
            for j in range(max(0, i - window), min(len(review), i + window), 1):
                if j != i:
                    X.append(review[i])
                    Y.append(review[j])
    X, Y = np.array(X), np.array(Y)
    Y = np.expand_dims(Y, axis = 1)
    return (X, Y)

X, Y = generate_training(encoded_reviews, 10)
```

## 3. Implementation

The following notations and explainations are based off of this [note](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/cs224n-2019-notes01-wordvecs1.pdf). Let $V$ be the vocabulary size, $h$ be word vector dimension, $V \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times h}$ be the input word matrix, and $U \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times h}$ be the output word matrix. 

+ Furthermore, let $u_{i}$ be the $i$-th row of $U$ and $\tilde{v} = V^{\top}x \in \mathbb{R}^{h}$, where $x \in \mathbb{R}^{V}$ is the one-hot encoding of word $w$.
+ From word vector $\tilde{v}$, generate score vector $z = U\tilde{v}$, from which a probability distribution over words can be genreated with $\hat{y}$ = softmax$(z)$.

Given $T$ words, the log-likelihood to maximize for the Skip-gram model is

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{\ell}(V, U) &= \log\prod_{t = 1}^{T}P(w_{t - m}, \dots ,w_{t - 1}, w_{t + 1}, \dots ,w_{t + m} | w_{t})\\
&= \log \prod_{t = 1}^{T} \prod_{j = 0; j \neq m}^{2m}P(w_{t - m + j}|w_{t})\\
&= \log \prod_{t = 1}^{T}\prod_{j = 0; j \neq m}^{2m}\frac{\exp(u_{t - m + j}^{\top}\tilde{v}_{t})}{\sum_{k = 1}^{V}\exp(u_{k}^{\top}\tilde{v}_{t})}\\
&= \sum_{t = 1}^{T}\left(\sum_{j = 0; j \neq m}^{2m}u_{t - m + j}^{\top}v_{t} - 2m\log \sum_{k = 1}^{V}\exp(u_{k}^{\top}v_{t})\right)
\end{align*}
$$

assuming strong independence assumption between target words conditional on context word $w_{t}$. Maximizing log-likelihood can be achieved by minimizing negative log-likelihood or the average negative log-likelihood over words.

$$
\mathcal{J}(V, U) = -\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t = 1}^{T}\left(\sum_{j = 0; j \neq m}^{2m}u_{t - m + j}^{\top}v_{t} + 2m\log \sum_{k = 1}^{V}\exp(u_{k}^{\top}v_{t})\right)
$$

The computational problem with the above formulation is that the vocabulary size $V$ is typically huge. An alternative is to optimize a cost function that approximates $\mathcal{J}(V, U)$, yet is computationally more efficient via negative sampling. In negative sampling, target words are distinguished from non-target words using logistic regression. In other words, a pairing between context and target word has positive class label and a pairing between context and non-target word has negative class label. Let 

$$
\begin{align*}
P(Y = 1 | w, c) = \sigma(u_{w}^{\top}\tilde{v}_{c}) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-u_{w}^{\top}\tilde{v}_{c})},
\end{align*}
$$

where $Y$ is class label, $w$ is target word, and $c$ is context word. Let $D$ denote positive class dataset and $\tilde{D}$ denote negative class dataset. Then the cost function under the formulation is

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{J}(V, U) &= -\log\left(\prod_{(w, c) \in D}P(D = 1 | w, c)\prod_{(w, c) \in \tilde{D}}P(D = 0|w, c)\right)\\
&= -\sum_{(w, c) \in D}\log\left(\frac{1}{1 + \exp(-u_{w}^{\top}v_{c})}\right) - \sum_{(w, c) \in \tilde{D}}\log\left(\frac{1}{1 + \exp(u_{w}^{\top}v_{c})}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

In practice, it may not be necessary to construct entire $\tilde{D}$ for decent performance. Thus, the practical implementation minimizes the following cost function

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{J}(V, U) = -\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t = 1}^{T}\left(\sum_{j = 0; j \neq m}^{2m}\sigma(u_{t - m + j}^{\top}\tilde{v}_{t}) - \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\log \sigma(-\tilde{u}_{k}^{\top}\tilde{v}_{t})\right)
\end{align*}
$$

where $$\tilde{u}_{k}$$ corresponds to non-target words of $$w_{t}$$. Negative sampling refers to the sampling of $K$ word pairs of negative class, where $K = 10$ is chosen. 

In Tensorflow 2.1.0., the negative sampling defined above is assumed to be implemented by $\texttt{tf.compat.v1.nn.sampled_softmax_loss()}$. Note that softmax with 2 classes is equivalent to logistic regression

$$
\begin{align*}
P(Y = 1, z_{1}, z_{2}) &= \frac{e^{z_{1}}}{e^{z_1} + e^{z_2}}\\
&= \frac{1}{e^{z_2 - z_1} + 1}\\
&= \frac{1}{e^{-z} + 1}
\end{align*}
$$

where $z = z_1 - z_2$. A few implementation notes:

+ Input word matrix will be initialized with values drawn from uniform distribution in the range [-1, 1).
+ Output word matrix will be initialized with values drawn from a normal distribution mean -1 and standard deviation 1. Values whose magnitude is more than 2 standard deviations from the mean are dropped and re-picked.

Initialize graph, session, and model.

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
V = len(np.unique(X))

model = word2vec(sess, V, n_embedding=300, batch_size=2048)
```

Training will print the following progress messages. In addition to printing the training loss based on softmax, we also print the original loss, which the training loss approximates.


```python
model.train(X, Y, epochs = 5)
```

```

## 4. Word Vector Evaluation

The quality of the word vectors are assessed with analogical reasoning tasks introduced by Mikolov _et_ _at_.[2]. The reasoning task is successful by satisfying an equation such as the following

```
vec(queen) - vec(woman) = vec(king) - vec(man)
```

where `vec(queen)` means the word vector of "queen". We evaluate performance of this task by testing whether

```
vec(queen) - vec(woman) + vec(man) = ?
```

yields `vec(king)` as the closest vector out of all word vectors in terms of cosine similarity. Obtain word vectors for all words.


```python
tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()

model = word2vec(sess, V, n_embedding=300, batch_size=2048)
saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver()
saver.restore(sess, 'models/word2vec.ckpt')

unique_tokens = np.unique(X)
word_vectors = model.get_embedding(unique_tokens)
```

    INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from models/word2vec.ckpt


Functions for analogical reasoning tasks.


```python
import heapq

def cosine_similarity(x, y):
    return x.dot(y) / (np.linalg.norm(x) * np.linalg.norm(y))

def closest_k_vectors(word_vectors, words, label_encoder, model, k = 10):
    encoded_words = label_encoder.transform(words)
    embeddings = model.get_embedding(encoded_words)
    vector = embeddings[0] - embeddings[1] + embeddings[2]
    
    heap = []
    # get closest k vectors 
    for i in range(len(word_vectors)):
        if i not in encoded_words:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (cosine_similarity(word_vectors[i], vector), i))
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
    
    heap.sort(reverse = True)
    return list(label_encoder.inverse_transform([w for s, w in heap]))
```

In this notebook, we illustrate that our word vectors can satisfy the following relationships

1. queen - woman = king - man
2. brother - boy = sister - girl
3. woman - man = uncle - aunt



```python
wordgroups = [["queen", "woman", "man"], ["brother", "boy", "girl"],
              ["woman", "man", "uncle"]]

for group in wordgroups:
    print("{0} - {1} + {2} = ?".format(group[0], group[1], group[2]))
    print("Top 10 closest words in descending order: ", 
          closest_k_vectors(word_vectors, group, label_encoder, model, k = 10))
    print(" ")
```

    queen - woman + man = ?
    Top 10 closest words in descending order:  ['last', 'king', 'powerful', 'almost', 'title', 'wars', 'one', 'war', 'back', 'better']
     
    brother - boy + girl = ?
    Top 10 closest words in descending order:  ['sister', 'shes', 'really', 'also', 'married', 'woman', 'playing', 'things', 'get', 'named']
     
    woman - man + uncle = ?
    Top 10 closest words in descending order:  ['wife', 'played', 'family', 'old', 'young', 'aunt', 'falls', 'mother', 'lady', 'married']
     


However, our word vectors fail at satisfying other relationships presented by Mikolov _et_ _at_.[2]. Underperformance could be due to size of training dataset, type of training dataset, and training time.
